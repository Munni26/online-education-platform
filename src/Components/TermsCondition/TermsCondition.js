                <h5>Accounts</h5>
                <p>You need an account for most activities on our platform, including purchasing and enrolling in a course. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage, to us or anyone else caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access until you can provide us the login credential information for that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be terminated.

                    If you share your account login credential with someone else, you are solely responsible for what happens with your account and Bohubrihi will not intervene in disputes between students who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon knowing that someone else may be using your account without your permission by contacting our Support Team. Our team may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of that account.</p>

                <h5>Payments, Credits and Refunds</h5>
                <p>We regularly run promotions and sales for our courses and specific courses are only available at discounted prices for a set period. The price applicable to a course will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the course. Any price offered for a course may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions will be available to new registered users only.</p>
